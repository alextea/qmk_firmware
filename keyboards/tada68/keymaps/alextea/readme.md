# Custom TADA68 layout for ISO UK with Apple-specific tweaks

This layout is a clone of the [mattgemmell](../mattgemmell) layout, but changes
the homing keys to act as media keys.

See my [keyboard layout gist](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/037117075638851003539b6dcb17900d)

## Installation

Please see the [Tada68 readme](../../readme.md). Make the firmware wih the
following command:
